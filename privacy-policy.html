We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making
sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your
information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a

<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="where-this-applies"></a> 2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Lomi. For simplicity, we refer
    to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy
    Policy on all applicable services.</p>
<p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then
    that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="information-we-collect"></a> 3. Information We Collect</h3>
<p>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as
    basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use
    our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services
    through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>
<h4>Information you give us</h4>
<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details
        necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>
    <li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your
        personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To
        add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the
        information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for
        example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this
        information, you consent to our processing of that information.</li>
    <li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as
        iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit
        card number or other financial information.</li>
    <li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services,
        responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>
    <li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to
        register or enter.</li>
    <li>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes,
        we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li>
    <li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us
        to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give
        us in order to complete your request.</li>
    <li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the
        operation of the services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information we receive from others</h4>
<p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li><strong>Other Users</strong>
        Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information
        about you from other users if they contact us about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media</strong>
        You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Lomi
        account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some
        information from your social media account with us.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Partners</strong>
        We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Lomi ads are published on a partner’s
        websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information collected when you use our services</h4>
<p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the
    devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li><strong>Usage Information</strong>
        We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time
        you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring
        webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect
        and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Device information</strong>
            We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</p>
        <ul class="unordered-list">
            <li>hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps
                settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both
                of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ settings), browser
                type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other
                technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address);</li>
            <li>information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal
                strength;</li>
            <li>information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Other information with your consent</strong>
        If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various
        means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The
        collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the
        permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your
        geolocation, we will not collect it.
        Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo,
        video or streaming on the services).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="cookie-and-similar-tech"></a> 4. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies</h3>
<p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you
    and/or your device(s). You may read our <a href="https://lomi.date/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more information on why we
    use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends,
    delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how
    you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</p>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track”
    (“<strong>DNT</strong>”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity
    tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from
    collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not
    yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Lomi, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="how-we-use-info"></a> 5. How We Use Information</h3>
<p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your info to
    help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you. Read on for a more detailed

</ul>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="how-we-share-info"></a> 6. How We Share Information</h3>
<p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with
    other users. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating
    the services, with other Element one Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about
    how your information is shared with others.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li>
        <h4>With other users</h4>
        <p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including
            your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is
            stuff that you’re comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do
            with your information once you share it.</p>
        <p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information
            about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>With our service providers and partners</h4>
        <p>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services. These third parties assist us with various
            tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment
            processing and security operations.</p>
        <p>We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services. For
            instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising
            partners.</p>
        <p>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner. All of
            our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>With other Eleme Group businesses</h4>
        <p>Lomi is part of the Element one Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes
            websites and apps such as Lomi, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24,
            OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click <a href="https://mtch.com/">here</a>).</p>
        <p>We share your information with other Element one Group companies for them to assist us in processing your
            information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf. Assistance provided by other
            Element one Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance,
            customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding
            how our service is used and users’ behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and
            fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.</p>
        <p>We may also share information with other Element one Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as
            corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws. We may also
            share user information with other Element one Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or
            have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior. In some instances, we may remove that user
            from all platforms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>For corporate transactions</h4>
        <p>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale,
            acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of
            ownership or control.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>When required by law</h4>
        <p>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court
            order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements;
            (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to
            protect the safety of any person.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>To enforce legal rights</h4>
        <p>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened
            lawsuit; (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or
            other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or
            take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>With your consent or at your request</h4>
        <p>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it
            clear why we want to share the information.</p>
        <p>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you
            are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified
            form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above
            circumstances. We may also share this information with other Element one Group companies and third parties
            (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or
            applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this
            information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable
            form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be
            found in our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="cross-border-data"></a> 7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</h3>
<p>Sharing of information laid out in <a href="#how-we-share-info">Section 6</a> sometimes involves cross-border data
    transfers, for instance to the Ethiopia of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service
    allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), their personal information is transferred to
    countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable
    safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments
    between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="your-rights"></a> 8. Your Rights</h3>
<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li><u>Access / Update tools in the service.</u> Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or
        delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service.
        If you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help <a
            href="https://goLomi.com/help">here.</a></li>
    <li><u>Device permissions.</u> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and
        notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your
        settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the
        display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full
        functionality.</li>
    <li><u>Deletion.</u> You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li><u>Reviewing your information.</u> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal
        information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of
        portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in
        such a request <a href="https://account.goLomi.com/data">here.</a></li>
    <li><u>Updating your information.</u> If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we
        are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing,
        please contact us <a href="https://goLomi.com/help">here.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can
    answer the above requests.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe
    on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information
    relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other
    user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.
</p>
<p>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably
    where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our
    service if we do not have your date of birth.</p>
<ul class="unordered-list">
    <li><u>Uninstall.</u> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard
        uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier
        associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile
        device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li>
    <li><u>Accountability.</u> In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a
        complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal
        information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual
        residence, where you work or where we are established.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="residents-of-addis-ababa"></a> 9. Residents of Addis Ababa</h3>
<p>If you are a Addis Ababa resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about
    you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.
    To request this notice, please submit your request <a href="https://goLomi.com/help">here</a>. Please allow 30
    days for a response. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of
    identity before we can answer such a request.</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="how-we-protect-your-info"></a> 10. How We Protect Your Information</h3>
<p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal
    information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise,
    and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>
<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information
    collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.
</p>
<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.
    If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately <a
        href="https://goLomi.com/help">here</a></p>
<p>In order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against unauthorized access, theft and loss,
    we implemented a bug bounty program. For more information about our bug bounty program, please click <a
        href="https://hackerone.com/Lomi">here.</a></p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="how-long-we-retain"></a> 11. How Long We Retain Your Information</h3>
<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in <a
        href="#how-we-use-info">Section 5</a>) and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of
    our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account
    deletion. During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be
    visible on the services anymore.</p>
<p>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention
    window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</p>
<ol>
    <li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply
        with statutory data retention obligations);</li>
    <li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms,
        Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>
    <li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is
        resolved; or</li>
    <li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing
        users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for
        unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above
    guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical
    constraints.</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="childrens-privacy"></a> 12. Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on
    our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect
    that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</p>
<h3 class="text-heading"><a name="policy-changes"></a> 13. Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may
    change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the
    changes.</p>
